          As the creator of this To-Do List website,I present a platform
          designed with dedication to help you organize and manage your daily
          tasks efficiently.With a strong commitment to quality and focus on
          users, I hope this website can provide an experience productive and
          facilitate the journey towards achieving your goals. I developed this
          website using custom SASS on the Persona 5 game theme, giving it a
          unique design touch and inspired aesthetic. I believe that the visual
          elements adopted from Persona 5 not only make the appearance more
          attractive , but also creates a more enjoyable and memorable user
          experience.
